# File Extraction & Processing Pipeline

This repository contains a Python-based pipeline designed for extracting data from a variety of file types, including PDFs, Word documents, images, and more. The pipeline integrates with Google Drive for file access, and supports advanced processing like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and object detection using YOLO. Additionally, it optionally uses OpenAI to refine detected objects in images.

## Requirements

Before using the pipeline, ensure that you have the following Python dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary libraries for:
- Google Drive and authentication (`google-auth`, `google-api-python-client`)
- OCR and image processing (`pytesseract`, `Pillow`)
- PDF and text extraction (`pdfplumber`, `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`)
- YOLO for object detection (`ultralytics`)
- OpenAI API for AI refinement of detected objects
- Excel and CSV handling (`pandas`)
- Miscellaneous utilities (`requests`)

## Setup

1. **Google Drive API Credentials**  
   Create a `credentials.json` file from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). The credentials file will be used to authenticate the script for accessing files from your Google Drive account.

   Add the file to the root directory of this project. Make sure the file has the necessary permissions (`Drive API` with `read-only` scope).

2. **Set up OpenAI API (optional)**  
   If you want to use the AI-based refinement for YOLO object detection, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

3. **Folder Structure**  
   The pipeline will create the following directories if they don't exist:
   - `downloads/` - Temporary folder for storing downloaded files.
   - `extracted_output/` - Folder for saving the extracted content of the processed files.
   - `processed_files.json` - A log file to track already processed files.

## Usage

### Main Process

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### What it Does:
1. **Authenticate**: The script will authenticate with Google Drive and fetch a list of files.
2. **Download**: It will download each file locally for processing.
3. **Extract Content**: For each file, it performs text extraction, image OCR, hyperlink extraction, and YOLO object detection (if applicable).
4. **Save Results**: The extracted data will be saved as a JSON file in the `extracted_output/` folder.
5. **Track Processed Files**: The `processed_files.json` log ensures files that have already been processed are not reprocessed.

### Supported File Types:
- PDFs
- DOCX and DOC files
- Text files (.txt)
- CSV and Excel files
- Images
- PowerPoint presentations (PPTX)
- Video (Placeholder)
- Google Docs (Placeholder)

For unsupported files, a placeholder will be used.

### YOLO Object Detection
If the file contains images, YOLO will be used to detect objects within the images. Detected objects will be refined using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model (optional).

## File Extraction Functions

- **PDF**: Extracts text, images (via OCR), and hyperlinks.
- **DOCX**: Extracts text, images (via OCR), and hyperlinks.
- **CSV/Excel**: Extracts text and hyperlinks from CSV/Excel files.
- **Images**: Uses OCR to extract text and YOLO for object detection.
- **PowerPoint**: Placeholder for PPTX extraction.
- **Video**: Placeholder for video transcript extraction.
- **Google Docs**: Placeholder for Google Docs extraction.

## Example Output

For each processed file, a JSON file will be saved with the following structure:

```json
{
  "file_id": "file_id",
  "file_name": "example.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "source_url": "https://drive.google.com/...",
  "extracted_content": {
    "text": "Extracted text content...",
    "images_text": "OCR-extracted text from images...",
    "hyperlinks": ["https://example.com", "http://anotherlink.com"],
    "detected_objects": ["car", "tree"],
    "objects_ai_refined": "The image contains a car and a tree."
  }
}
```
